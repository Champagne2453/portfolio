        <b class="b">T</b>his story is of summers, my father loves plants, animal, birds.Infact there were many times he bought injered birded 
        to our home in order to help them get better.This you to happen often when we use to live near sea coat, now we have 
        transfered to city, but still whenever he see's some injured or ill living being he brings him home.We have a small garden type backyard in which my father has planted many plants and as usual he was watering plants and trees he saw 2 bulbul on telephone wire upside.We all heard and saw glimpes of them for few times now.Just after that few days bulbuls statred weaving their nest. <br /> <br />
        We all were excited to see the nest just in few days bulbuls weaved beautiful nest.there were mainly two bulbuls around but sometimes we also so four bulbuls together.We had nest before in our backyard but of other birds like dove and tailor birds etc. This was the first time for bulbuls.my dad and i were keeping eye on them if they need anything or everything is going well.I use to fill water and put some grains on ground and birds like sparrows and other small birds use to play around that. Within no time their beautiful nest was fully ready. Another day we saw one egg in nest the and we were happy. I dont know seeing that egg why we were happy, well then after 3 days we saw another egg in nest. Now there werre 2 eggs and later 2 days wee saw another egg in nest so now its 3eggs, they were redish, so small and dustish in color.
        Bulbul used to get really angry and attack us if we try to go near her nest. So mostly we use to watch them when she is not around. 1 week past, she used to sit on eggs and hatch them. <br /> <br /> </p>

        when my dad leaves for office at that time usually bulbul use to go out and her nest remains security free! so that time dad use to check on eggs and then leaves for work. One day in morning we saw she wasnt there. We thought she must be hungry and left for search of food. So we came closer to nest and started peeking and we couldnt see eggs in nest, we thoght they must have rolled futher inside so i and my little brother called dad and asked to see on eggs, when he came and saw nest it was empty! dad was pretty suprised, initally we thought eggs got rolled down and got cracked. So we started searching for them under the tree and we saaw almost whole lawn area but couldnt find white shell or egg-yolk around.
        Everyone was sad with this unsettling info. We thought either crow or eagle too her eggs. After that we didnt saw her for few months but after period of time we saw bulbuls on tree.
        <br /> <br />

        I have no idea are they same bulbuls? or her babies survived and grew and came back or what else? 
        Well this is part i saw happening, it never happened that bird eggs got disapear in just one night. I googled about the same thing and i saw 1 story in which her bulbul eggs were disapear in one random night. I dont have any pratical theory on this as i dont know what actually she does with her eggs. One theory says that She might build another nest in some more quiter and safer area and shift their eggs when nest is weaved in night time. Another theory of mine is that may be eagle took her eggs and she is heart-brokken mother so she never comes back to her nest.  <br /> <br />
        So this is my story of <i>"Bulbul-A story of missing eggs"   </i>
